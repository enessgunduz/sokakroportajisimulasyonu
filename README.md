This game is about a popular consept in Turkey, street interviews. It's so famous now to have street interviews and share it. And people like to watch the answers that 
citizens give. 

I tried to handle the funny parts of that and give some serious messages via the game. I hope you enjoy the game.

This is my first game I published at the market. I learnt so much things while I was making it. I learnt how to design 3D objets, ads settings, animations, UI designs and so on.
And I hope you can use it in your projects. I did my best to keep my code clean.
